# Changes Made for Appium-Python-Client 5.0 Compatibility

## Overview
This document describes the changes made to make the `elementHelperAppium.py` and `elementHelperAppium_Tests.py` files compatible with Appium-Python-Client 5.0.

## Backup Files
Before making any changes, backup files were created:
- `elementHelperAppium.py.bak`
- `elementHelperAppium_Tests.py.bak`

## Changes to elementHelperAppium.py

### Import Changes
```python
# Old imports
from appium.webdriver import webelement
from appium.webdriver import webdriver
from appium.webdriver.common.appiumby import AppiumBy

# New imports
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from appium.webdriver.webdriver import WebDriver
from appium.options.common.base import AppiumOptions
```

### Element Locating Method Changes
```python
# Old method
element = driver.find_element(AppiumBy.XPATH, selector)

# New method
element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, selector)
```

```python
# Old method
list_of_elements = driver.find_elements(AppiumBy.XPATH, selector)

# New method
list_of_elements = driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, selector)
```

## Changes to elementHelperAppium_Tests.py

### Import Changes
```python
# Old import
from appium.webdriver.common.appiumby import AppiumBy

# New import
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
```

### Test Assertion Changes
All assertions that used `AppiumBy.XPATH` were updated to use `By.XPATH` instead:

```python
# Old assertion
self.mock_driver.find_element.assert_called_once_with(AppiumBy.XPATH, "//some/xpath")

# New assertion
self.mock_driver.find_element.assert_called_once_with(By.XPATH, "//some/xpath")
```

## Explanation
In Appium-Python-Client 5.0, the API structure has changed significantly from version 3.2.1. The main changes are:

1. The `AppiumBy` class has been replaced with the standard Selenium `By` class for basic locators like XPATH.
2. The import structure for WebDriver and WebElement has changed.
3. The way options are configured has been updated with the new `AppiumOptions` class.

These changes align with the latest Appium server versions and provide better integration with Selenium WebDriver.
